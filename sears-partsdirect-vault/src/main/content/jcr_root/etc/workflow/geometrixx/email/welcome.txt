How this template works:

Use the email headers you need and seperate them with a blank line
from the message body. you can replace variables using the ${...} syntax.
You can get a list of all workflow related variables by including the "properties"
variable (see example below).

You can access all properties of a JCR payload (i.e. a JCR node) by using the
"payload." prefix. for example, if you create a 'title' property with a form,
you can include it with ${payload.title}.

All Workflow properties:
